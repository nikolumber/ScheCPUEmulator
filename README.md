### Introduction
This project is a Java-based CPU emulator that aims to simulate fundamental CPU operations for educational purposes. The emulator is designed to simplify understanding of how CPUs function, making it accessible and easy to learn for those new to computing.

This emulator runs in a "locked-down" mode: programs are loaded at compile-time, meaning the memory and instructions cannot be modified at runtime. This limitation allows beginners to focus on core CPU mechanics without additional complexity.


### Project Goals


### Emulator Design

### Usage

### Examples

### Future Improvements
- [ ] Create a Minecraft-Port of the emulator to run inside Minecraft and add Mechanics to control Redstone via an CPU
- [ ] Create a higher level language than schessembler (started, unfinished yet)
- [ ] Add a debugger
- [ ] Add a way to modify the program at runtime
- [ ] More ways to restrict the use of the CPU to make it save for running in a prod environment
